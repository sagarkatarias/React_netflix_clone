# React Netflix clone

The project aims to create a clone of the original netflix application with features such as the top banner that shows random favorite movies in the location every time you reload the page. And multiple rows showing different categories of movies/documentaries which can be scrolled horizontally using track pad. Clicking on any tile of the movie, plays a trailer of that movie, which is fetched from youtube using 'youtube react' library. All the data displayed on the app is dynamic fetched from the TMDB API.

## Running application

You would need to install the basic react node modules to run app in dev mode and then simply run 'npm start' to host in on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Tech/Libraries used

* React with react hooks
* Latest es7 syntax
* TMDB Api
